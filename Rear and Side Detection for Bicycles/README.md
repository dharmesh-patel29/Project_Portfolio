# Bicycle Rear and Side Object Detection
# Abstract
Nowadays people riding bicycles on the roadside face an oncoming threat. Based on the statistics on bicycle accidents in total, 129,207 two-wheeled vehicle users were engaged in incidents on German roads in 2019, 4.5 percent less than in 2018. The number of motorcycle accidents declined by about 9%, from 31,419 to 27,927, while the number of deaths reduced from 619 to 542. In 2019, there were 13,925 accidents involving two-wheeled motor vehicles with insurance plates. Our goal with this project is to create a device that can warn a cyclist of an impending harm. Following extensive study, our device can detect an approaching vehicle from the left, right, or rear side within 5m and notify its speed and existence to the ride on their phone with minimal errors. The rider can adjust the device scanning radius up to 7ms.

# To ensure the safety of the bicyclist, three HB100 and one RCWL sensors were mounted on the rear and sides of the bicycle which are connected over a Wifi Network with a custom Phone application to alert the rider about the incoming object from rear and sides.
