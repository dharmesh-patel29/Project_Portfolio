# Phase Change Material (PCM) in Automotive Climate Control System (1)
- After entering the cabin of an automobile during the
summer, especially during the sunny days, drivers feel severe
thermal discomfort just after entering the car, especially when the
vehicle is parked facing the sun in the parking lot. Therefore, a
considerable amount of cooling energy must be used to lower the
temperature to a comfortable level so that, when using the phase
change material, the comfort level can be maintained. A stationary
automobile facing the sun is fitted with this innovative system to
control the interior temperature. During the melting and
solidification of phase-change materials, the energy of the heating
is absorbed and released by pouches lining in the car's top inner
side.
